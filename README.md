# kattisJavaSolutions
# Welcome to my kattis solutions. They are named either as the full problem name or a keyword (or acronym if long)
# my solutions are often in dire need of refactoring as I focus on understanding the problem and coding solution
# over readability, although some solutions required abstraction in order to keep my head straight. This is not to
# suggest I do not enjoy refactoring, but kattis does not allow you to edit submissions and requires a full new one
# everytime something is changed, which is enough to persuade me not to.
